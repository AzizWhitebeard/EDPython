If there is an error finding the x button with pixelMatchesColor
go to power shell and type this
it happened to me asw
	pip install pyscreeze
This fix is about 94% success rate for x buttons

you may use skype for "ban protection" or whatever have 2 accounts 1 main pc then 1 on yr
phone or something
	just replace powershell with skype
	MAKE SURE, you have your alt account on skype already pulled up.
	In Matrix and Jugg at the top put
	skype = True
	and press "ctrl + s"
	then you should be fine
